# Selecting the Project Framework

## Identify Project Methodologies

• Waterfall
- Oldest
- Linear
- One stage must finish before start the next one
- Requires clear requirements
Requirements > Design > Implementation > Testing > Delivery > Maintenance

- Pros:
 ○ Easy to learn and use
 ○ Adaptable
 ○ Easy for PMs to track and use
 ○ Thorough documentation (detailed and careful)
- Cons:
 ○ Inflexible 
 ○ Changes will restart the project at start line
 ○ High cost of change
 ○ Requires planning the project at the beggining
- DO NOT USE if you expect:
 ○ Frequent releases
 ○ Enhancemnts after implementation
 ○ Affordable and desirable changes

• Agile
- Adaptable to change
- Employees self-organize agile teams
- Aims to release products early and often
- Iterative incremental development

- Pros:
 ○ Adaptable
 ○ Allows change and uncertainty
 ○ Early testing and quality checks 
 ○ Frequent, affordable updates
 ○ Gives workers more autonomy
 ○ Customer-driven features
 ○ Ongoing-enhancements increase competitiveness
- Cons:
 ○ Prone to scope creep
 ○ Moving targets and missed deadlines
 ○ Requires highly skilled and motivated teams
 ○ Less emphasis on documentation
- DO NOT USE:
 ○ Short simple projects
 ○ Projects that need requirements early  

• Scrum : the most common agile frameworks
- Lightweight
- Minimum requirements
- Empiricism and lean thinking
 ○ Values
  + Commitment
  + Focus
  + Openness
  + Respect
  + Courage
 ○ Pilars
  + Transparency
  + Inspection
  + Adaptation

- Roles & responsibilities
Scrum Team: they build the spring backlog & sprint goal
Product Owner: identify which enhacements will be buildt next. 
	       tend to product backlog and set the product goal.
Scrum Master: coaches the team to improve their scrum applicaton
Developer: remaining scrum team members (not PO or SM)

-Events: 
Sprint: 1-4 week timebox for all sprint events 
Spring planning: select work for upcoming sprint
Daily Scrum: plan the next 24h
Sprint review: inspect progress and adapt the product
Sprint retrospective: reflect on the team's perfomance and improve

- Pros:
 ○ Lightweight
 ○ Problem-solving focus
 ○ Customer-centric
 ○ Fast pace delivers cosiderable quantities of work
- Cons:
 ○ Requires a precise environment
 ○ Requires respect for the product owner's decisions
 ○ Harder for inexperienced teams to adapt
 ○ Team changes significantly reduce capacity
 ○ Pace and schedule can lead to employee burnout
- DO NOT USE:
 ○ Teams with routine, predictable work
 ○ Project with frequently changing team members

• Kanban
- Agile framework
- Older than agile and software, started in lean manufacturing.
- Highly visual: kanban board is recognizable and used across many methodologies
- Aims to increase completed work by controlling Work In Progress (WIP)
- Work is pulled from backlog through predetermined workflow stages until finished state

- Visualization:
To do > in progress > review > done
- Workflow:
 1) Product owner prioritizes and orders backlog
 2)A team member selects the top-ordered item in the backlog and pulls it into progress
 3)The team moves teh work through the workflow keeping the WIP limits
 4)When the team is ready to start new work, they select the next item in the backlog

- Core Principles
Visualize work
Limit WIP
Make policies explicit
Manage flow
Implement feedback loops
Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally
Notes:
Transparency through visual work helps to identify bottlenecks
Reduce WIP increases focus and reduces context switching

- Pros:
 ○ Simplest framework to learn
 ○ Applicable to any industry
 ○ Works well for repeatable routine tasks
 ○ Stable workflows
 ○ Good for predictable process but unpredictable backlog (helpdesk)
 ○ Good for teams that thrive without structure
- Cons:
 ○ Sensitive to large teams and team changes
 ○ Prone to longer cycle times without active perfomance managment
- DO NOT USE:
 ○ Unpredictable workflows 
 ○ Teams with high turnover
 ○ Cadence and structure needed
 ○ Regular releases and feedback needed

• Extreme Programming (XP)
- Agile framework
- Heavy emphasis on software engineering
- Applicable outside software development
- XP takes good software engineering habits to extreme and codifies as practices
- Reviews code while writing it. Pair programming: 2devs 1keyboard

- Roles:
Customer: selects next feature
Tracker: captures metrics and look for improvements
Coach: Mentors the team on XP
Notes: XP is customer  and delevoper focused framework, 
improves developers quelity of life and customer product.

- Values: 
Communication
Simplicity
Feedback
Respect
Courage
Notes: extremely simple code
solve problems with the least amoutn of work
continually evolving framework
can be customized and applied with other frameworks

- Pros:
 ○ Exceptionally efficient
 ○ Modernized development sistems out of necessity
 ○ Higher success rate
 ○ Good for small stable teams
 ○ Good for teams that react fast to change
 ○ Projects with thight deadlines
 ○ Access to customer
- Cons:
 ○ Limited focus on product desing
 ○ Pace can lead to stress for developers
 ○ Minimal documentation
- DO NOT USE:
 ○ Teams with limited access to automation
 ○ Teams with functional roles and limited need to collaborate

• DevOps
- More an organizational structure than a project methodolgy
- Software engineering practices
- Integrates software dev and IT Operations with people
- Increases efficiency and quality by improving communicaton

- Workflow: CI/CD
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
Continuous Integration: frequently check code into the main branch 
& run automated test
Continuous Deployment: automated process prepare and releases code to production

Cycles:
Plan > code > build > test > release > deploy > operate > monitor >> (repeat)

- Pros:
 ○ Less friction
 ○ More cross-functional collaboration
 ○ Increased automation
 ○ Frequently deployments (faster delivery for customers)
- Cons:
 ○ Extensive skill requirements per team
 ○ Spacialist teams may need time to adapt
 ○ Limited applicability for systems lacking automation

- Managing DevOps:
 ○ Agile DevOps Teams:
   + Smaller increments of functionality
   + Longer dev time, more integration, test debug cycles
   + Minimal deployment tasks
   + Fewer dependencies
 ○ Agile Teams without DevOps:
   + Increments smaller than waterfall, larger tha DevOps
   + manual test, integration and deployment (bottleneck)
   + Longer integration and delpyment tasks
   + More dependencies

• DevSecOps: Second Gen DevOps
- Builds IT security into the DevOps cycle
- Significant culture shift for most organizations
- Reduces security as a shared service 
  and increases decentralized decision-making
- Everybody owns security in DevSecOps

• Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
- Defines how to use many frameworks together
- Introduces some structure to help multiple tems coordinate on cadence
- Agile at scale: for multiple agile teams working together while   
  retaining the flexibility of agile
 ○ SAFe Terms:
- Agile Team: any team regardless fo framework or methodolgy
- Agile Release Train (ART): group of teams working together
- Iteration: timebox for development
- Program Increment (PI) longer-term planning cycle 
- Program Increment Planning (PI planning): planning event for an ART

- Pros:
 ○ Apply agile practices across many teams
 ○ Builds connections between business and technology teams
 ○ Scalable to any size
 ○ Coordinate many agile teams
 ○ Good for projects spanning multiple teams
- Cons:
 ○ Adds overhead layer and staff
 ○ Limits team's decision-making authority
 ○ Adds structural constrains to the team (cadence synchronization)
- DO NOT USE:
 ○ Individual teams

• Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
- Phase-based software development framework
- Increase quality, reduce costs via continual improvement
- Managing software for its entire lilfe cycle - from planning to its eventual decommissioning
- Phases customized by organizations (fit lessons learned and various frameworks)
- SDLC model typical contains 5-8 phases

- SDLC Lifecycle:
Planning > Requirements > Design > Development > Testing > Deployment / back to req > Operations

- Pros:
 ○ Comprehensive framawork
 ○ Incorporates thorough documentation
 ○ Reduces risk, cost & time
- Pros:
 ○ Requires advanced planning 
 ○ Constrain for agile teams

• PRojects IN Controlled Environment (PRINCE2):
- Process-based project management methodology
- Aims to manage resources and lower risk with structured phases, task & roles
- The most customizable framework
- Common in Europe & Australia (UK gov standard)
- Started as waterfall and has adopted an agile model

- Roles:
Team Manager: help PM with team supervision and quallity management
Project Board: authorizes resources and funding. Consists of 
Executive: represents the business's perspective
Senior user:represents the customer's perspective
Senior supplier:represents the implementation partner's perspective

- Structure:
7 principles, themes & processes 
Tailored to suit the project environment
 ○ Principles
  + Continued business justification
  + Learn from experience
  + Defined roles & responsibilites
  + Manage by stages
  + Manage by exception
  + Focus on products
  + Tailor to suit the product
  Note: principles are mandatory, everything else can be added, removed or changed
