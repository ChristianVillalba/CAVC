# Create a Project Plan

## Refine the Timeline

• Projecct Network Diagrams
 ○ Precedence Diagram Method (PDM)
  - Visualizes activities, dependencies, and sequencies using boxes & arrows
  - Simple diagram for summarizing a full project in a single page
  - Starting point for other project diagrams
  - Program Evaluation and Review Techinique (PERT):
   + Optimistic (O)
   + Pessimistic (P)
   + Most Likely (M)
	PERT estimate (time weeks) : (O + 4M + P) / 6 
 ○ Critical Path Method (CPM)
  - Project schedule analysis technique
  - Finds the critical path
  - Used to identify the activities that are congrolling the project length
  - PM's use of the Critical Path
   + Closely manage these activities
   + Shorten the length or break dependencies
   + Negociate deliverables, resources and dependencies
   + Manage schedule expectations
  - CPM Analysys Process
   + Draw the project activities and dependencies
   + Calculate the PERT estimate duration for each activity
   + Complete a forward pass to calculate the early start and early finish
   + Complete a backward pass to calculate the late start and late finish
   + Calculate the total float (TF)
   + Calculate the free float (FF)
   + Identify the critical path

## Establish Project Baselines
• Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Early version of a product
- Just enough functionality to prove value
- Cornerstone of iterative incremental development
• Detailed Scope Statement 
- Expands on the preliminary scope statement
- Uses the same template as the preliminary scope statement
-Finalizes the project scope for baselines
Note: after the scope and baselines are set, adjustments or changes 
are sent through a formal change request process
• Detailed Scope Statement 
 ○ Expanded Preliminary Scope Fields
  - Project Scope Description
  - Project Acceptance Criteria
  - Project Deliverables (in scope)
  - Project Exclusions (out of scope)
  - Assumptions
  - Constrains
 ○ New Detailed Scope Fileds
  - Milestones
  - Requirements 
  - Tasks 
  - Risks
  - Budget
  - Estimates and Estimation Methods
• Estimate Costs
 ○ Types:
  - Direct cost
   + Associated with a specific resource or activity
   + Estimated and tracked via resource cost rate
  - Indirect cost
   + Support multiple operation
   + Consuption cannot be associated with a specific resource
   + Estimated or assigned , based on organizational norms
 ○ Resource Cost Rate
  - The cost per a unit of measure (UOM)
