     - Keep them in a centralized log
     - Logs must be available and editable (by stakeholder)
     - Keep issue information (inc prioritization) in the issue log
     - Note: appropiate scalation
  2) Analyze
     - Root cause: source
     - Key to Permanently fixing issues

       + / (r2 correlation positive) 
       + \ (r2 correlation negative)
       + :: (r2 = 0 no correlation)
       + Note: scatter diagrams measure correlation
               Do not guarantee causation
     - Run Chart
       + Time-based line chart
       + Plots the value of the same metric over timef
       + Useful monitoring trends and ongoing perfomance
     - Preto Chart
       + Frequency chart
       + Rearranges categories to show most frequent issues on the left
       + Identify priorities, relevant factors
     - Five-why:
       + Loods for teh source of issues under multiple symptopms
       + Easy to learn and use
       + Connection between causes and distant effects	
     - Issue prioritization tools:
       ○ Severity:
         + Critical: system down
         + Major: mayor features unavailable
         + Minor: key features require a workaround
         + Low: all features are functinal 
       ○ Urgency
         + Critical: resolve immediately
         + Major: resolve within hours
         + Minor: resolve within days
         + Low: resolve when convinient
       ○ Impact on project
         + High: project may not finish
         + Medium: project may be delayed
         + Low: project will be fine
       ○ Impact on organization
         + High: impacts large customer segment
         + Medium: impacts many (eg: a dept)
         + Low: impacts few (a couple of users)
       ○ Issue Escalation
         + High: Already escalated
         + Medium: escalation points defined but not reached yet
         + Low: no plans to escalate																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							
  3) Resolve
     - Escalate and create escalation plans as needed
     - Assign an owner who will then resolve the issue
     - Execute contingency plans
  4) Monitor
     - Issue resolution plan:
       + Monitor resolved issues so they stay resolved
       + Ensure issues aren't more problematic than expected
       + Monitor project performance to identify new issues
