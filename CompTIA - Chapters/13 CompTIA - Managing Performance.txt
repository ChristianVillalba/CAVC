# Managing Performance

## Measure Performance
- Creates a plan to evenly space out work and resources
- Manages Resources consumption
- Teams track work  remaining by day for an iteration
- PMs can track a project or phase with a burndown

• Scope Burndown Chart
 - Used for a fixed asset - scope, time or budget
 - Units need to be small enough to measure often
   + Story Points
   + Deliverables
 - Scope changes can appear as spikes and drops in the remaining work value

• Budget Burndown Chart
 - Fixed budget suits burndown charts
 - Valuable cost control tool
 - Compares the pace of spending to the pace of the project
 - Simple visual for assesssing if the project is going to run out of funds
 - Used mostly by PMs instead of the team, but should be shared
 - Actual remaining budget should be higher than the target remaining budget
 ○ Perfomance gap:
   - Each gap indicates a need for a decision
   - Applies to a positive or negative variance
   - Preserve ideal conditions
   - Eliminate damaging factors
   - Note: Understand the reason for a result: 
     positive variance can have negative causes
 ○ Project Perfomance Gap Analysis:
   - Each gap indicates a need for a decision
   - Applies to + o - variances
   - Preserve ideal conditions
   - Eliminate damaging factors
   - Obj: bring discrepancies closer to the goal 
   - Note: closing gaps is a gradual process 
     (time between implementing solutions and seeing the results)

• Contigency Reserve Utilization
 - Project Baseline = Project Estimate + Contigency Reserves
 - Contigency reserves: funds to cover the cost of realized risk
 - PM authorizes use
   + Reduce the contigency reserve balance
   + Increase the project estimate
 - After using contigency reserves:
   + Project Baseline = Project Estimate + Contigency Reserves

• Earned Value Management (EVM)
 - Metrics for monitoring project performance
 - Uses 3 data points: 
   + PV - Planned Value Target cost and schedule
   + EV - Earned Value
   + AC - Actual Cost
 - PV (Planned % Complete) x BAC (Budget at completion)
   +  BAC Budget at completion = project cost baseline

CV (over budget) = EV - AC 
Cost Performance Index = EV / AC
SV 
CV below 50
