CHAPTER 5
• A project manager drafts a high-level design (HLD) document 
prior to an upcoming corporate and client meeting. 
What characteristics best describe a HLD document?
◘ It is created during the analysis phase of the SDLC process 
and assesses technical feasibility.
◘ It is a conceptual design that describes 
how the solution will need to work and integrate.

• A manufacturing company needs to develop a report that shows its stakeholders 
which resources generate the most revenue for the company. 
Which of the following charts follows a principle that contends that 
a relatively large number of problems or defects, typically 80 percent, 
are commonly due to a relatively small number of causes, typically 20 percent?
◘ A Pareto chart visualizes the Pareto principle using lines and columns. 
Each column represents the counts of a category, 
and the columns appear in descending order by total count. 
The line on the chart measures the total percentage of the count. 
This line will slope upward.

• A solution architect decides how they can best maximize 
their time remaining before they must deliver software to a client. 
How should the architect prioritize the features of the software 
and still meet their deadline?
◘ The architect needs to understand the business requirements and 
how flexible they are. 
The functional requirements will deliver the most value to the client 
in this scenario.

• A government organization needs to select a secure method 
for communicating with public customers. 
Their top priorities are protected communication and 
adherence to regulatory guidelines. Which of the following 
solution design elements are the most critical in this scenario? 
◘ Compliance ◘ Security

• A project manager requests the cyber subject matter expert to evaluate 
an upcoming project’s IT infrastructure model. 
What characteristic is associated with a single-tier architecture?
◘ It is not separated and is a typical structure for test and small production requirements. 

• A dashboard analyst develops reports and dashboards for 
external partners that did not sign a non-disclosure agreement. 
What type of privacy considerations must be taken into consideration 
when developing outward facing reports?
◘ Is the data already public and will not cause relative harm 
if viewed by outside parties?
◘ Does the dashboard reflect internal data, 
which is not otherwise public information?
◘ Does the dashboard contain confidential data, and if so, 
has access been set appropriately?

• What are the three most common tiers in an N-tier architecture?
◘ Presentation
◘ Application
◘ Data

• A project manager (PM) develops a graph for the team's stakeholders. 
The PM wants to be able to visually depict a comparison in the improvement 
in quality scores against the cost of achieving them. 
What type of project tool would best meet the PM's requirements?
◘ Law of diminishing returns chart
A chart depicting the law of diminishing returns will compare 
improvement in quality scores against the cost of achieving them.

CHAPTER 6:

• A database manager has begun to notice a decline in 
key performance indicators (KPIs) on their database. 
What phase focuses on the updating, maintenance, 
and evaluations of used resources? (same answer than)
• During which phase of the Resource Lifecycle should a well-established firm 
focus on employee retention for a yearlong project centered on 
continuous software development?
◘ The maintenance and monitoring phase represents the operational 
support that people, systems, and equipment need to run smoothly. 
Resources need regular updates, maintenance, and evaluation. 
The company also works on employee retention in this phase.

• A project manager prepares to distribute tasks to the project team. 
Before doing this, the project manager must determine 
each team member's available time. 
How will the project manager calculate a team member's available time?
◘Subtracting overhead hours from the available working hours will determine 
the time left for allocation in this scenario.

• One of the three quality assurance (QA) testers for a website project 
has complained about being burned out. Upon checking the skills matrix, 
the project manager (PM) sees that of the three, the burned-out QA tester 
is an expert QA for backend testing, optimization, and mobile testing. 
How would the PM handle this situation of an employee experiencing burnout? 
◘ Check the utilization gap for other testers and level the resources.
◘ Train other QA testers to increase team performance.

• A project is two weeks behind schedule, and the project manager (PM) 
does not know why. So the PM is planning a team brainstorming activity 
to find the potential cause of this delay. 
What gap analysis tool will the PM use?
◘ A fishbone diagram, also known as a cause and effect diagram, 
is a tool that helps to visualize various factors that impact a single outcome. 

• A project manager needs to establish a project team for a new web design 
project. Before assigning responsibility and bringing on team members, 
what must the project manager conduct?
◘ A needs assessment identifies what a project will need to provide to solve 
a business problem. 
It defines which resources the project needs, including skills, 
software, equipment, and other tangible and intangible resources.

CHAPTER 7:

•A senior developer for an e-commerce website of critical importance 
has to go on leave of absence due to a family emergency. 
What should a project manager (PM) do for this risk?
◘ Follow the contingency plan for this risk.
 Since the risk will happen, the PM should follow the fallback plan (the risk contingency plan).

• After several months of building and testing the e-commerce marketing feature, 
it is ready to go live. The development team has invited the operational team 
for the hand-off. 
The project manager senses conflict during this period. 
What can the project manager do in this case?
◘ Follow the transition plan guidelines.

• The equipment delivery team leader has left a voicemail saying that 
a forest fire in California might prevent the equipment from arriving on time. 
The team leader wanted to give the customer an advanced warning. 
Which of the following statements is true?
◘ A trigger for a risk is an indication that a risk event is likely to occur. 
In this scenario, the delivery team leader sending a voicemail about 
the potential delay due to the forest fire serves as an alert or 'trigger' 
that a specific risk (delayed equipment delivery) may materialize.

• The project manager (PM) has identified a risk event on the current project 
that could save $50,000 in project costs if it occurs. 
Based on this, which of the following is true?
◘ This risk event is an opportunity, and the PM should exploit it.
 therefore, it is a positive risk.







CHAPTER 9: 

• What is the main signal between the end of the project planning phase and the beginning of the execution phase?
◘ The approval of the project management plan marks the end of the project planning phase 
and the beginning of the execution phase. 
Once the project sponsor, project manager, and functional managers approve the project plan, 
this is the signal that the team can begin delivering work. 

• The project to build software for a point-of-sale system has just ended, 
and the project team has conducted a retrospective or lessons learned meeting. 
The project manager stores the outputs from this meeting in a lessons learned document for which primary reason?
◘ The lessons learned document becomes a reference point for future projects. 
Whenever a project manager (PM) starts a new project, part of the initiation process is 
reviewing existing lessons learned to help improve the next project's plan.

• A project manager (PM) has just been assigned to a new high-priority project to manage at the end of the planning phase. 
The PM has the preliminary scope statement, which the previous PM created in the initiation phase. 
There are also more detailed definitions for the project goals, scope, and requirements. 
What project document is the PM ready to finalize?
◘ The detailed scope statement finalizes the project scope for the planning process. 
The PM can validate the project plan against the preliminary scope by creating a detailed scope statement. 
In this case, the former PM has completed the preliminary scope and further defined the project goals, requirements, and deliverables. 
So, the PM is ready to finalize the scope statement. 
The detailed scope statement contains the baseline, the WBS, and the project plan.

• The project manager (PM) on a software build contract has sent a minimally viable product (MVP) for user acceptance testing (UAT). 
The UAT tester immediately got an error message and could not appropriately test the core functions. 
Upon review, the PM discovered an error in the code that affected one of the main features of the MVP.
What type of software test could have caught this error?
◘ Smoke test 

• What quality management activity presents finished deliverables (outputs) to the customer to see if the project meets the customer's expectations?
◘ Validation is a project activity that occurs outside the team and looks only at finished deliverables with the customer. 
Validation is subjective as it measures desirability. 
It presents outputs to the customer to see if the project meets their expectations. 
The customer either accepts the result to validate the project or rejects it.

• A client for a software design project has indicated that the software engineer must develop three software features 
early on for the product to be minimally viable. 
Why is creating a minimally viable product (MVP) for the client an essential step? (Select all that apply.)
◘ The minimum viable product (MVP) is an early version of the product. 
However, it has enough functionality to demonstrate how the product will operate so stakeholders can use it and provide feedback.

• What is the main difference between contingency reserves and management reserves?
◘ Contingency reserves are a calculated cost buffer that covers documented or forecasted risks, 
while management reserves are an additional sum of time or money that covers setbacks that are not forecasted.

◘ The smoke test runs after the code compiles into a build and before it deploys to confirm that 
the main features are working before detailed tests are run. 
A smoke test will ensure the core features work. No other tests can run until the core functions can perform.
