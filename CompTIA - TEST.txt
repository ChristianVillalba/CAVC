CHAPTER 5
• A project manager drafts a high-level design (HLD) document 
prior to an upcoming corporate and client meeting. 
What characteristics best describe a HLD document?
◘ It is created during the analysis phase of the SDLC process 
and assesses technical feasibility.
◘ It is a conceptual design that describes 
how the solution will need to work and integrate.

• A manufacturing company needs to develop a report that shows its stakeholders 
which resources generate the most revenue for the company. 
Which of the following charts follows a principle that contends that 
a relatively large number of problems or defects, typically 80 percent, 
are commonly due to a relatively small number of causes, typically 20 percent?
◘ A Pareto chart visualizes the Pareto principle using lines and columns. 
Each column represents the counts of a category, 
and the columns appear in descending order by total count. 
The line on the chart measures the total percentage of the count. 
This line will slope upward.

• A solution architect decides how they can best maximize 
their time remaining before they must deliver software to a client. 
How should the architect prioritize the features of the software 
and still meet their deadline?
◘ The architect needs to understand the business requirements and 
how flexible they are. 
The functional requirements will deliver the most value to the client 
in this scenario.

• A government organization needs to select a secure method 
for communicating with public customers. 
Their top priorities are protected communication and 
adherence to regulatory guidelines. Which of the following 
solution design elements are the most critical in this scenario? 
◘ Compliance ◘ Security

• A project manager requests the cyber subject matter expert to evaluate 
an upcoming project’s IT infrastructure model. 
What characteristic is associated with a single-tier architecture?
◘ It is not separated and is a typical structure for test and small production requirements. 

• A dashboard analyst develops reports and dashboards for 
external partners that did not sign a non-disclosure agreement. 
What type of privacy considerations must be taken into consideration 
when developing outward facing reports?
◘ Is the data already public and will not cause relative harm 
if viewed by outside parties?
◘ Does the dashboard reflect internal data, 
which is not otherwise public information?
◘ Does the dashboard contain confidential data, and if so, 
has access been set appropriately?

• What are the three most common tiers in an N-tier architecture?
◘ Presentation
◘ Application
◘ Data

• A project manager (PM) develops a graph for the team's stakeholders. 
The PM wants to be able to visually depict a comparison in the improvement 
in quality scores against the cost of achieving them. 
What type of project tool would best meet the PM's requirements?
◘ Law of diminishing returns chart
A chart depicting the law of diminishing returns will compare 
improvement in quality scores against the cost of achieving them.

CHAPTER 6:

• A database manager has begun to notice a decline in 
key performance indicators (KPIs) on their database. 
What phase focuses on the updating, maintenance, 
and evaluations of used resources? (same answer than)
• During which phase of the Resource Lifecycle should a well-established firm 
focus on employee retention for a yearlong project centered on 
continuous software development?
◘ The maintenance and monitoring phase represents the operational 
support that people, systems, and equipment need to run smoothly. 
Resources need regular updates, maintenance, and evaluation. 
The company also works on employee retention in this phase.

• A project manager prepares to distribute tasks to the project team. 
Before doing this, the project manager must determine 
each team member's available time. 
How will the project manager calculate a team member's available time?
◘Subtracting overhead hours from the available working hours will determine 
the time left for allocation in this scenario.

• One of the three quality assurance (QA) testers for a website project 
has complained about being burned out. Upon checking the skills matrix, 
the project manager (PM) sees that of the three, the burned-out QA tester 
is an expert QA for backend testing, optimization, and mobile testing. 
How would the PM handle this situation of an employee experiencing burnout? 
◘ Check the utilization gap for other testers and level the resources.
◘ Train other QA testers to increase team performance.

• A project is two weeks behind schedule, and the project manager (PM) 
does not know why. So the PM is planning a team brainstorming activity 
to find the potential cause of this delay. 
What gap analysis tool will the PM use?
◘ A fishbone diagram, also known as a cause and effect diagram, 
is a tool that helps to visualize various factors that impact a single outcome. 

• A project manager needs to establish a project team for a new web design 
project. Before assigning responsibility and bringing on team members, 
what must the project manager conduct?
◘ A needs assessment identifies what a project will need to provide to solve 
a business problem. 
It defines which resources the project needs, including skills, 
software, equipment, and other tangible and intangible resources.

CHAPTER 7:

•A senior developer for an e-commerce website of critical importance 
has to go on leave of absence due to a family emergency. 
What should a project manager (PM) do for this risk?
◘ Follow the contingency plan for this risk.
 Since the risk will happen, the PM should follow the fallback plan (the risk contingency plan).

• After several months of building and testing the e-commerce marketing feature, 
it is ready to go live. The development team has invited the operational team 
for the hand-off. 
The project manager senses conflict during this period. 
What can the project manager do in this case?
◘ Follow the transition plan guidelines.

• The equipment delivery team leader has left a voicemail saying that 
a forest fire in California might prevent the equipment from arriving on time. 
The team leader wanted to give the customer an advanced warning. 
Which of the following statements is true?
◘ A trigger for a risk is an indication that a risk event is likely to occur. 
In this scenario, the delivery team leader sending a voicemail about 
the potential delay due to the forest fire serves as an alert or 'trigger' 
that a specific risk (delayed equipment delivery) may materialize.

• The project manager (PM) has identified a risk event on the current project 
that could save $50,000 in project costs if it occurs. 
Based on this, which of the following is true?
◘ This risk event is an opportunity, and the PM should exploit it.
 therefore, it is a positive risk.


CHAPTER 8:

◘ WBS: work breakdown structure
◘ Using the three-point estimate (E), E = (O + M + P)/3

• A project manager (PM) must break down the work to the company's engineers 
for a website development project, with a hard deadline of five weeks. 
The marketing team has requested three fixed and three preferred deliverables 
for the project if the time is available. 
The team is self-organizing. How will the PM break down this project?
◘ The project backlog is a better choice since the project has a flexible scope, 
fixed time, and resources.

• A project manager (PM) must break down the development of 
a game development project to its five engineers, three testers, 
and two designers. The team is currently using the agile framework 
to develop the game.
How could the PM break down the project backlog?
◘ Epic is a significant deliverable that the PM can break down further 
into features that can further break down to user stories. 
Here the PM needs to break down the project backlog and use the Epic, 
Features, and User Stories.

• The company has hired a project manager (PM) to manage the execution of a project. 
However, a new college intern is unsure of what work to accomplish on the project 
and asks the PM. Where can the PM find the detailed description of 
the work packages?
◘ The PM should consult the work breakdown structure (WBS) dictionary 
to get detailed information about what tasks the intern needs to accomplish. 
For example, the WBS dictionary contains information about tasks 
each team member needs to complete, responsibilities, prerequisites, 
due dates, etc.

• A project manager (PM) is about to start the breakdown of a project 
for execution. The PM follows which order for the WBS creation process?
◘ First, the PM should review the scope of the project. 
After capturing the project's scope, the PM should identify 
the deliverables to turn into a work breakdown structure (WBS). 
After determining the deliverables, the PM should identify the team members 
with the skills needed for the project. Finally, the PM should use either 
a grouping or construction method to create the level 2 elements of the project 
WBS.

• A junior project manager (PM) assigns resources to a 
delivery tracking software project. 
Upon checking the responsibility assignment matrix (RAM), 
the PM finds that two senior developers are accountable for the app development 
activity's progress, four junior developers are responsible for working 
in the app development activity, one software architect for consultation, 
and a project director for reporting. 
What could be the potential issue in this RAM?
◘ In the RAM chart, the accountable person will be held accountable for completing the work. 
Having more than one person accountable for the same activity increases ambiguity 
and could also lead to misdirection of the project. 
So two senior developers accountable for the software development activity 
could lead to ambiguity.


CHAPTER 9: 


◘ TF Same activity, can start without delaying anything else
◘ FF Between Following acts. ES.B- EF.A

◘ critical path method (CPM) diagram

• What is the main signal between the end of the project planning phase and the beginning of the execution phase?
◘ The approval of the project management plan marks the end of the project planning phase 
and the beginning of the execution phase. 
Once the project sponsor, project manager, and functional managers approve the project plan, 
this is the signal that the team can begin delivering work. 

• The project to build software for a point-of-sale system has just ended, 
and the project team has conducted a retrospective or lessons learned meeting. 
The project manager stores the outputs from this meeting in a lessons learned document for which primary reason?
◘ The lessons learned document becomes a reference point for future projects. 
Whenever a project manager (PM) starts a new project, part of the initiation process is 
reviewing existing lessons learned to help improve the next project's plan.

• A project manager (PM) has just been assigned to a new high-priority project to manage at the end of the planning phase. 
The PM has the preliminary scope statement, which the previous PM created in the initiation phase. 
There are also more detailed definitions for the project goals, scope, and requirements. 
What project document is the PM ready to finalize?
◘ The detailed scope statement finalizes the project scope for the planning process. 
The PM can validate the project plan against the preliminary scope by creating a detailed scope statement. 
In this case, the former PM has completed the preliminary scope and further defined the project goals, requirements, and deliverables. 
So, the PM is ready to finalize the scope statement. 
The detailed scope statement contains the baseline, the WBS, and the project plan.

• The project manager (PM) on a software build contract has sent a minimally viable product (MVP) for user acceptance testing (UAT). 
The UAT tester immediately got an error message and could not appropriately test the core functions. 
Upon review, the PM discovered an error in the code that affected one of the main features of the MVP.
What type of software test could have caught this error?
◘ Smoke test 

• What quality management activity presents finished deliverables (outputs) 
to the customer to see if the project meets the customer's expectations?
◘ Validation is a project activity that occurs outside the team 
and looks only at finished deliverables with the customer. 
Validation is subjective as it measures desirability. 
It presents outputs to the customer to see if the project meets 
their expectations. 
The customer either accepts the result to validate the project or rejects it.

• A client for a software design project has indicated that 
the software engineer must develop three software features 
early on for the product to be minimally viable. 
Why is creating a minimally viable product (MVP) for the client an essential step? (Select all that apply.)
◘ The minimum viable product (MVP) is an early version of the product. 
However, it has enough functionality to demonstrate how the product 
will operate so stakeholders can use it and provide feedback.

• What is the main difference between contingency reserves 
and management reserves?
◘ Contingency reserves are a calculated cost buffer that covers documented 
or forecasted risks, while management reserves are an additional 
sum of time or money that covers setbacks that are not forecasted.

◘ The smoke test runs after the code compiles into a build and before 
it deploys to confirm that 
the main features are working before detailed tests are run. 
A smoke test will ensure the core features work. No other tests can 
run until the core functions can perform.


CHAPTER 10:


◘ capital expense (CapEx)
◘ statement of work (SOW)
◘ request for proposal (RFP)

• An organization has earmarked a new data center as a capital expense (CapEx) 
that the organization will procure in two years. However, a current project 
needs storage for cloud data, and the current data center will not be viable 
for this purpose. As the project manager (PM), 
what is the best way to proceed?
◘ Rent cloud storage from a third-party vendor and include it as OpEx.
Operating expenses (OpEx) can include an organization's regular expenses, 
such as salaries, taxes, and recurring expenses 
(i.e., subscriptions, rentals, and utilities). 
Therefore, the organization could justify renting cloud storage from 
a third-party vendor as an operating expense.

• What is the main difference between a procurement contract 
and a purchase order (PO)?
◘ A procurement contract establishes an agreement to purchase something 
at some point, while a PO is a customer's request 
for specific goods or services.

• What type of statement of work (SOW) describes the expected outcomes 
and minimum performance standards?
◘ Performance SOW (statement of work) 
A performance SOW describes the expected outcomes along with minimum performance 
standards. It is more fixed than a functional SOW, 
but it is still outcome-focused and flexible for vendors.

• A procurement specialist collects information to develop the criteria 
to include in a request for proposal (RFP) for a specific product. 
What function can the procurement specialist perform to collect information 
about the product, industry trends, and potential suppliers?
◘ Market research
Market research provides procurement specialists with information 
to learn about products or services. 
The specialist collects information about the product, the suppliers, 
and industry trends. Market research prepares the team 
for product procurement by giving them the insight to include 
better criteria in an RFP request for proposal . 

• A potential vendor is reviewing a request for proposal (RFP) 
and statement of work (SOW) for a new project. 
The project manager (PM) wrote the SOW as a functional SOW outlining 
the requirements of the finished product only. In response to the RFP, 
what would be suitable for the vendor to address since the PM 
provided a functional SOW? (Select all that apply.)
◘ A creative approach used in a previous project with a similar deliverable
◘ A list of prior performances building the same product to 
  demonstrate a variety of approaches
In a functional SOW, how to deliver the product is left to the vendor,
who can propose alternative approaches or scope adjustments.
It would be suitable to mention prior performance in creating 
the same product to demonstrate a variety of approaches. 
In a functional SOW, the vendor can propose alternative approaches.

• A project manager (PM) is managing the vendor relationship of 
a virus detection software project. The PM determines that the vendor 
and the project team should communicate weekly regarding the project 
deliverables and that each team member should articulate a recognition 
at the retrospectives. The PM should document these types of expectations 
in what artifact?
◘ Rules of engagement
Rules of engagement should incorporate the vendor's obligations, 
such as a plan for approving deliverables or providing feedback promptly. 
Rules of engagement monitor team performance and also call attention 
to deviations. The cadence of discussing deliverables and creating 
opportunities to boost morale and productivity are examples of rules 
of engagement.

• A project manager (PM) is working on an upcoming software upgrade project 
with a defined scope. The software upgrade will take several years 
due to multiple phases of upgrades. 
Which type of contract provides for incentives or additional payments 
if the project meets specific targets or goals, such as finishing 
the project ahead of schedule and receiving an extra $500,000 as a result?
◘ Fixed-price incentive fee
A fixed-price incentive fee contract offers incentives or additional payments 
if the project meets specific targets. The client identifies specific targets 
by measurable performance on the contract. 
The client would be satisfied if the project came in on time but has 
the funds to cover stretch goals.

• A project manager (PM) completes vendor evaluation techniques 
to determine which vendor to select for a project. 
The PM finds that vendor A has a great reputation and offers 
an approach to the project that is desirable and reliable. 
Vendor A's quote is higher than expected, but reasonable. 
Vendor B has an unknown reputation and offers an approach to the project 
that is unique but untested in the market. 
Vendor B's quote is lower than expected. 
What evaluation technique was applied, and what vendor should be selected?
◘ Best value evaluation technique, select Vendor A
Best value evaluation considers cost and additional performance factors 
when selecting the vendor with the most value at a reasonable cost. 
Vendor A is the best value due to the vendor's reputation, 
desirable approach, and reasonable cost.

• A senior manager attended a regional conference 
and interacted with several competitor clients. 
At the conference, the senior manager learned that the contractor 
is currently working on a high-cost retail website project 
for the senior manager's firm. 
The contractor has a history of overbilling for their work. 
The senior manager returns from the conference and asks to see 
verification of all the evaluation techniques utilized to select this vendor. 
The project manager (PM) provides evidence of a vendor demonstration, 
technical approach review, and evidence of financial solvency. 
What evaluation technique did the PM miss that could have discovered 
this information?
◘ Reference checks
Reference checks inquire about the vendor's history 
with former clients. Reference checks reveal information from 
the sources that the PM might not receive elsewhere, such as how they 
interact with the client, their responsiveness, and their cost management. 
A reference check could have revealed information regarding 
the contractor's overbilling.

• What is NOT an element of a warranty?
◘ Cost 
is not something that a warranty covers. 
A warranty is a contractual obligation, explicit or implied, 
that goods or services will meet a predetermined standard, 
and the contract addendum would typically include them.


CHAPTER 11:


◘ requirements traceability matrix (RTM) 
◘ Sprint planning uses historical performance to predict future performance. 
Therefore, the team should have a goal based on historical performance.
◘ The phase gate review meeting occurs at every phase gate 
and at the end of the project. 

• The project team has been working on an application software
for the past 20 days. 
The target for completed work on the burnup chart estimates 
14 task hours a day. 
On day 20, the project team completed 308 task hours over the 
20 day period. What does this imply?
◘ The team has exceeded their schedule by 28 task hours.
◘ The team has been averaging more than the estimated task hours per day.


CHAPTER 12:


◘ Scatter diagram
◘ change control board

• The project manager (PM) creates a scatter diagram to analyze whether 
faults occur during nightly scheduled system outages. 
The scatter diagram yields an R2 of 0. 
What conclusion can the PM draw based on the scatter diagram?
◘ An R2 correlation value of 0 indicates that no relationship exists 
between the two variables: faults occurring and nightly scheduled system outages.

• A new project manager (PM) is looking to perform a root cause analysis 
to determine why the project is running behind schedule. 
Which of the following types of analysis might the PM find effective 
and easy to use as a starting point? (Select all that apply.)
◘ A scatter diagram graphically demonstrates the relationship 
between two root cause variables. 
catter plots work well with large data and create an easy-to-read diagram. 
However, they are not a simple form of root cause analysis.

• The project team plans to monitor when the implemented changes 
begin to affect system performance. 
The team will look for what type of variation?
◘ Special cause variation
Special cause variations are unique events indicating that something 
changed about a process and created an unusual outcome.

• A project team is working on the release of an application to 
internal users of a company. The users are not expected to use this 
application outside of business hours. A project team member notifies 
the project manager (PM) that a missed maintenance window caused a core 
system feature of the application to no longer function after 
business hours on a Friday evening. 
The PM escalated the necessary change request and received 
emergency authorization to schedule the system update for 
Sunday morning so as not to delay the project any further. 
What priority level should the project manager assign 
this issue on Sunday morning?
◘ Major severity, medium urgency, medium impact
The issue is major severity yet medium urgency with 
an unplanned downtime over the weekend. 
The problem will have a medium impact by delaying the project.

• A project manager (PM) works on a project that includes 
a change control board. 
How does the PM's role in the change control process 
look different on this project than on a project without a change control board? 
(Select all that apply.)
◘ The change control board evaluates, approves, and denies change requests.
◘ The PM receives and analyzes change requests and makes recommendations 
to the change control board.

• The project team plans to notify customers about changes to 
how they log in to a system. 
The team plans to inform customers that login credentials 
will remain the same, but the logging-in process will look different. 
This type of change falls into what category?
◘ Normal change
Normal changes are modifications that do not have a set process 
and do not happen often. 
These changes are planned in advance and require customer notifications 
to varying degrees.

• The project manager submits a change to the software code for approval. 
What type of approvals will the project manager request?
◘ Product owner approval
◘ Architectural approval
◘ Technical approval
Software products often have several owners who will review 
and approve changes, either in place of or alongside a change control board.
Software is integral to business operations, and the company's information 
flows through multiple software systems. 
Any piece of software in the architecture could be the source of truth for another system, 
and changes could have a ripple effect throughout the organization. 
Therefore, the organization's architects must evaluate these impacts.
Technical staff familiar with the systems must review and approve source code 
changes and configuration changes.

• A project manager (PM) leads the team in conducting a thorough 
root cause analysis. Why is this an important process? (Select all that apply.)
◘ Project teams conduct root cause analysis to prevent issues from reoccurring.
◘ Root cause analysis allows the team to determine why an issue is occurring.

• The project manager (PM) asks the team to meet and brainstorm solutions together
 to resolve a project issue. 
Why should the team members bring issues to the team for group analysis 
instead of generating solutions individually? (Select all that apply.)
◘ Groups can work together to find solutions that individuals cannot.
◘ Individuals cannot often solve complex problems, nor do complex problems 
have only one root cause.

• The project manager (PM) evaluates a change request
for modifying project deliverables to include updating a legacy system. 
The operational team responsible for that system does not already participate 
in the project, and the PM will request their participation. 
What type of change does this represent?
◘ A strategic change
Strategic changes include decisions with effects beyond the boundaries of 
the project. 
This change involves a system outside the current project scope 
and will require additional project resources in the form of 
additional team members.
